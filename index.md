### Interacting with APIs: Example with the Food data API

I am creating a vignette to show how to contact an API using functions I’ve created to query, parse, and return well-structured data.  Then we'll use them to do a little exploratory data analysis.

## Requirements 

To use the functions for interacting with the Food API, I used the following packages:  

- httr 
- jsonlite 
- tidyverse 
- devtools 

## API Interaction Functions

With Spring and Summer, some people like to plant a vegetable garden!  If you are adventureous, you like to plant something that you have never planted before to see if you can grow it and then experiment with its produce in the kitchen.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dkorver/food/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dkorver/food/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
